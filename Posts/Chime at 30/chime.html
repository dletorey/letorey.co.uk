    On 12 March 1990 Chime by Orbital was released. Well actually this is not entirely true, it was actually released in
    the December before on a limited release by <a href="https://www.kanefm.com/jazzy-m-and-the-ohzone-show/"
        title="Jazzy M &amp; Ohzone Records">Jazzy M's Ohzone Records</a>. The release that I'm talking about is the
    FFRR (London Records) release.
</p>
<p>
    For me every time I hear the intro, I get tingles and goosebumps and I start dancing. I've even run into shops
    before, when hearing it playing, dancing like a loon and then leaving.

<h2>
    Top of the Pops
</h2>
<p>
    On 29 March 1990, Orbital appeared on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_of_the_Pops"
        title="Top of the Pops on Wikipedia">Top of the Pops</a>, the weekly UK TV chart show, on BBC1.
</p>
<p>
    Top of the Pops, famously or infamously doesn't allow live performances. When Morrissey of the Smiths found out
    about this he refused to hold a microphone and instead <a
        href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/14/smiths-top-of-the-pops-debut"
        title="Smiths debut on Top of the pops">danced with a bunch of Gladioli</a>. When the The Orb, performed(?) Blue
    Room, they just <a href="https://vimeo.com/86875272" title="The Orb playing chess on Top of the Pops on Vimeo">sat
        on stage and played chess</a>.
</p>
<p>
    When Orbital found out about this restriction, they choose to place all the plugs of their equipment face up on top.
</p>
<p>
    In order to make the recording the day before transmission, Paul had to ask to swap shifts at the Pizza restaurant
    he worked in.
</p>
<blockquote>
    “I told the manageress ‘I can’t work on Wednesday.’ ‘Oh, why?’ ‘I’ve got to go and do Top Of The Pops ‘. Well, she
    just screamed. ‘Are you joking?’ I said ‘D’you know what? I don’t think I’m coming back.’

    My favourite Live version

<p>
    This is a toss up really between:
</p>
<h3>
    Glastonbury 25 June 1994
</h3>
<p>
    It was a bit mental that night. I went out the back of the crowd and could see the first proprer lasers, I'd seen,
    at an outdoor gig and could just see 10,000s of people going absolutely mental.
</p>
<p>
    Q Magazine named this gig number 51 in their list of the <a
        href="http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/qcollection.htm#100%20Greatest%20Gigs">best 100 gigs of all time</a>.
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noBHqhYRkN8">Video of Chime Glastonbury 1994</a>
</p>
<h3>
    Alexandra Palace 31 December 1996
</h3>
<p>
    They'd just ended the year with Satan and it got to midnight and the Big Ben Chimes came in. Orbital started messing
    with the Big Ben Chimes and in came the super fat bassline of Chime, I think I might I wet myself, a little, at that
    point.
</p>

</p>
<p>
    So if you see me and hear Chime playing:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Don't talk to me, wait until it's over
    </li>
    <li>
        Join me and dance like a loon
    </li>
