<h2 id="quote">Hitch Hikers @ 42</h2>
<p>As I said in recent(ish) talk, The Hitch Hikers Guide to Progressive Web Apps.</p>
<quote>At 10:30 pm on the 8th of March 1978 Douglas Adams invented the iPhone and Wikipedia.</quote>
<p>It was for a number of years until the world actually caught up with his mind. I feel that Steve Jobs totalled missed
    out on not naming the iPhone and/or the iPad, The Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy. I feel it would have been way
    more successful than it actually was.</p>
<h3>The Radio Series</h3>
<p>The radio series was the first incarnatinon of H2G2 and was first broadcast on BBC Radio 4, 22:30 8 March 1978.</p>
<p>The first series, now called the Primary Phase was in 6 parts, episodes or as it was actually Fits. Ifeel I know
    quite a lot about Hitch Hikers, but for the life of me I have no idea why the episodes wee called fits.</p>
<p>There have since been 4 more phases:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Secondary Phase</li>
    <li>Tertiary Phase</li>
    <li>Quandary Phase</li>
    <li>Quintessential Phase</li>
</ul>
<p>Although only the Primary Phase and Secondary Phase's were written by Douglas Adams. The Tertiary to Quintessential
    Phases released after he'd died in 2004</p>
<h3>The Book</h3>
<p>This is actually how I was first introduce to Hitch Hikers. By my cousin Sandra, after all BBC Radio4 10:30pm for 8
    year old was a bit late and not the kind of late that Slartibartfarst threatened Arthur with.</p>
<p>I loved this book so much, I read it and reread it. I still do to this day.</p>
<p>When I was at school I was terrible at English, many years later found out I have dyslexia. Due to the class I was in
    I got to fail my English O'Level 3 times before the age of 16. When I moved on to Sixth I had to carry on failing
    English. It wasn't until the sixth time that I actually passed. That sixth time, part of the exam I had to read a
    passage of text. The passage I was give was the beginning of chapter xxxx of Hitch Hiker Guide to the Galaxy. I
    asked the examiner: "Are you sure you want me to read this?". I'm positive that if it hadn't been that passage I'd
    still to this day be sitting my English exam.</p>
<h3>The Vinyl LPs</h3>
<p>The 2 LPs released in 1979 and 1980 were sections of the Radio Series edited into albums. The great thing about this
    is that I've often sampled and mixed these into DJ sets and Mixes and do so to this day.</p>
<h3>The TV Series</h3>
<p>The TV Series was launched on BBC2 in January and February 1981.</p>
<p>The work in making the book into a visual experience was an absolute delight. While it looks like it's all done with
    computer graphics, it is in fact completely hand drawn and then each line or letter exposed one by one.</p>
<h3>The Towel</h3>
<p>In the world of Hitch Hikers fans the Towel is quite possibly the most sort after version. It is not actually the
    book on a towel but the Book's definition of a Towel and how it is:</p>
<quote>is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitch hiker can have.</quote>
<h3>The Video Game</h3>
<p><strong>The game will kill you frequently. It's a bit mean like that.</strong></p>
<p>Released in 1984, this is the hardest game that has ever been created. You die and die and die and die and die, even
    if you know the story inside out.</p>
<p>The BBC now have <a
        href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/1g84m0sXpnNCv84GpN2PLZG/the-game-30th-anniversary-edition"
        title="Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy - The Game - 30th Anniversary Edition">an online version of this game
        where you yourself can die repeatedly.</p>
<h3>The Film</h3>
<p>Douglas tried many many time to get Hitchhikers, made into a film. It eventually was but not until after his death.
</p>
<p>There are few scenes in the film written by Douglas and they are by far the funniest of the whole film.</p>
<p>There is also a staircase in the film set that is based entirely on Douglas's nose.</p>
<h3>The Stage Show</h3>
<p>In the summer of 2012 the cast of the Original Radio Series was brought back together to perform a stage version.
    Each product a different person was brought in to play <em>The Book</em>. When I went to see this at Cambridge Corn
    Exchange, John Lloyd Narrated <em>The Book</em>.</p>
<h3>But which is my favourite?</h3>
<p>This is something that I've been asked/thought about many times. Really I don't have a favourite, they are all
    different, the most important thing is the work of Douglas. This is why the Film and Tertiary to Quintessential
    Phases, in my opinion don't live up to the rest.</p>
<p>Saying that I do have a favourite scene, sketch, part whatever it's called and that is the sudden formation of a
    <em>sperm whale and bowl of petunias</em>.</p>
<p>You've never experienced any form of Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, then I can highly recommend it. Just do not
    blame me if you get hooked.</p>
<p>Currently <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000g55m" title="The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is 42">BBC
