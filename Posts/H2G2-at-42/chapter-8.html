<p>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a wholly remarkable book. It has been compiled and recompiled many times over
    many years and under many different editorships. It contains contributions from countless numbers of travellers and
    researchers.</p>
<p>The introduction begins like this:</p>
<p>"Space," it says, "is big. Really big. You just won't believe how vastly hugely mindboggingly big it is. I mean, you
    may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist, but that's just peanuts to space. Listen . . ." and so on.
</p>
<p>(After a while the style settles down a bit and it begins to tell you things you really need to know, like the fact
    that the fabulously beautiful planet Bethselamin is now so worried about the cumulative erosion by ten billion
    visiting tourists a year that any net imbalance between the amount you eat and the amount you excrete whilst on the
    planet is surgically removed from your bodyweight when you leave: so every time you go to the lavatory it is vitally
    important to get a receipt.)</p>
<p>To be fair though, when confronted by the sheer enormity of distances between the stars, better minds than the one
    responsible for the Guide's introduction have faltered. Some invite you to consider for a moment a peanut in reading
    and a small walnut in Johannesburg, and other such dizzying concepts.</p>
<p>The simple truth is that interstellar distances will not fit into the human imagination.</p>
<p>Even light, which travels so fast that it takes most races thousands of years to realize that it travels at all,
    takes time to journey between the stars. It takes eight minutes from the star Sol to the place where the Earth used
    to be, and four years more to arrive at Sol's nearest stellar neighbour, Alpha Proxima.</p>
<p>For light to reach the other side of the Galaxy, for it to reach Damogran for instance, takes rather longer: five
    hundred thousand years.</p>
<p>The record for hitch hiking this distance is just under five years, but you don't get to see much on the way.</p>
<p>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy says that if you hold a lungful of air you can survive in the total vacuum of
    space for about thirty seconds. However, it does go on to say that what with space being the mind-boggling size it
    is the chances of getting picked up by another ship within those thirty seconds are two to the power of two hundred
    and sixty-seven thousand seven hundred and nine to one against.</p>
<p>By a totally staggering coincidence that is also the telephone number of an Islington flat where Arthur once went to
    a very good party and met a very nice girl whom he totally failed to get off with--she went off with a gatecrasher.
</p>
<p>Though the planet Earth, the Islington flat and the telephone have all now been demolished, it is comforting to
    reflect that they are all in some small way commemorated by the fact that twenty-nine seconds later Ford and Arthur
    were rescued.</p>
